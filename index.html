                    Let's start our HTML Adventure. As any story, our story has to be formatted nicely. To do this, we'll use the following HTML elements:
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="">Headings - h1 and h2</a></li>
                        <li><a href="">Paragraphs</a></li>
                    </ul>
                    Use the headings and paragraphs accordingly. And remember, the <pre><br></pre> tag is not a good solution for breaking down titles/paragraphs!

                    Super Mario Story
                    <br>
                    The story unfolds...
                    <br>
                    One day the kingdom of the peaceful mushroom people was invaded by the Koopa, a tribe of turtles famous for their black magic. The quiet, peace-loving Mushroom People were turned into mere stones, bricks and even field horse-hair plants, and the Mushroom Kingdom fell into ruin.
                    <br>
                    The only one who can undo the magic spell on the Mushroom People and return them to their normal selves is the Princess Toadstool, the daughter of the Mushroom King. Unfortunately, she is presently in the hands of the great Koopa turtle king.
                    <br>
                    Mario comes to the rescue!
                    <br>
                    Mario, the hero of the story (maybe) hears about the Mushroom People's plight and sets out on a quest to free the Mushroom Princess from the evil Koopa and restore the fallen kingdom of the Mushroom People.
                    <br>
                    You are Mario! It's up to you to save the Mushroom People from the black magic of the Koopa!
